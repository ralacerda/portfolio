          Biologist, graduated from the University of SÃ£o Paulo, finishing my

        <p class="aboutme__paragraph">
          I've always enjoyed programming. During my undergraduate studies, I
          learned how to write python script to automate task, and analyze and
          display data with R, I sharpened those skills during my graduate
          studies. I've been using GNU/Linux as my OS since 2018, which has
          taught me how to use the command line in depth, as well as learning
          how to navigate and solve problems in GNU/Linux.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutme__paragraph">
          Currently, I'm focused on learning Front-end technologies, with a
          solid knowledge of Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, basic notions of React,
          Tailwind and Bootstrap, and advancing my skills in Vue.js and Vite. I
          have experience in creating sites for events, automation scripts in
          Bash and Python, usage in Git and Github, and I've contributed with
          code and documentation for Open Source projects.

          I am a free software enthusiast, board games, computer games and
          Formula 1 fan. I also enjoy cooking and baking bread on weekends.

        <p class="aboutme__paragraph">
          I love learning new things, so I'm looking for an opportunity that
          helps me evolve as a developer.
