          I'm a Brazilian biologist, who graduated from the University of SÃ£o
          Paulo, finishing my Master's degree in Ecology from the University of
          Campinas, and currently changing careers to web development.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutme__paragraph">
          I learned python scripting and data analysis with R during my
          undergraduate studies, sharpening those skills during my graduate
          studies.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutme__paragraph">
          I've been using GNU/Linux since 2018, which has taught me how to use
          the command line in-depth, navigate and solve problems with the
          Operating System.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutme__paragraph">
          At this moment, I'm focused on Front-end development. I have practical
          knowledge of Javascript, HTML5, CSS3, and Vuejs. I also have
          experience creating sites for events, and using the command line, Git,
          Github, and Python. I've contributed code and documentation for Open
          Source projects.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutme__paragraph">
          I am a free software enthusiast, board games, computer games, and
          Formula 1 fan. I also enjoy cooking and baking bread on weekends.
        </p>
        <p class="aboutme__paragraph">
          I'm looking for an opportunity to help me evolve as a developer. I'm
          excited to learn new skills and strengthen those that I have.
